# Geometry Problem Solver

This is an ongoing project that I am developing for practice and out of curiosity. The goal of this project is to create a JavaScript application that solves geometry problems drawn on a canvas and provides explanations of the solution steps in a human-readable format.

Once the project becomes more stable and functional, I'll extend the README file.
